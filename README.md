###### Morse Code project for Arduino

I am still working on the documentation. I will add pictures and diagrams soon. But it is basically the same diagram as the arduino starter tool kit tutorials 100-104.pdf file page 11.



This is simple LED blinking light project for arduino for beginners just like me.
Code is simple too.  I will have few different styles.

* Basic
    * It is absolutely basic format and very easy to read.
    * I did this way so people who have no idea on C language can understand.
* Enhanced
    * I moved morse code related section to morsecode.h header file.
* Advanced
	* added a new function ````void stringToMorseCode(char arg[])```` to read the string of letters and numbers and convert into morse code
    * it accepts the string and convert.
* Expert (nah... not really) AND I didn't do this one yet either  haha~
    * just made it fancier :D
    * please forgive me, but think of it as trenta in terms of starbucks coffee ;-)
